This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(readxl)
df <- read_excel("C:/Users/madat/Projects/StockX Data/StockX-Data-Contest-2019-3.xlsx")
View(df)
```

```{r}
#Changing variables to factors
df$Brand<-as.factor(df$Brand)
df$`Sneaker Name`<- as.factor(df$`Sneaker Name`)
df$`Buyer Region` <- as.factor(df$`Buyer Region`)
df$`Shoe Size` <- as.factor(df$`Shoe Size`)
str(df)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
#Seeing which sneakers were bought the most frequently
df %>% count(`Sneaker Name`) %>% arrange(desc(n))
```
```{r}
#Seeing what state was most popular
df %>% count(`Buyer Region`) %>% arrange(desc(n))
```
```{r}
#Seeing what brand was most popular
df %>% count(`Brand`) %>% arrange(desc(n))
```
```{r}
#Seeing what size was most popular
df %>% count(`Shoe Size`) %>% arrange(desc(n))
```
```{r}
#Average price of the shoes by sneaker
avg <- aggregate(df$`Sale Price`, by=list(df$`Sneaker Name`), FUN=mean) 
avg <- avg[order(avg$x, decreasing=T),]
avg
```
```{r}
#Average price of the shoes by brand
avg <- aggregate(df$`Sale Price`, by=list(df$Brand), FUN=mean) 
avg <- avg[order(avg$x, decreasing=T),]
avg
```
```{r}
#Average price of the shoes by sneaker and state
avg <- aggregate(df$`Sale Price`, by=list(df$`Sneaker Name`, df$`Buyer Region`), FUN=mean) 
avg <- avg[order(avg$x, decreasing=T),]
avg
```
```{r}
#Average price of the shoes by brand and state
avg <- aggregate(df$`Sale Price`, by=list(df$Brand, df$`Buyer Region`), FUN=mean) 
avg <- avg[order(avg$x, decreasing=T),]
avg
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
